            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="special">My name is <em>Alexander Byrd, III</em>, and I enjoy reading comics/manga, binge-watching anime, and comic-book shows.  I dream of directing and producing my own animation so I am interested in expanding my skills and always searching for new things to learn.  I usually spend my free time working to becoming a better artist and animator in pursuit of my dream of producing and directing my own animation.  I will often digitally illustrate various things like: fanart, original characters, pictures, and backgrounds.  I obtained an Associate's Degree in graphic design and am currently enrolled in night/online classes to receive three certifications in: Animation, Web Design, and International Trade and Business Affairs-Japanese.  I hope that learning code will help me to present my art on custom web pages.</p>
                <p class="special">After spending years developing graphic design skills capable of completing tasks efficiently and expeditiously whether operating as an individual or within an organized team, I confidently utilize a firm understanding of proficiently connecting creative thinking to clients to business solutions to better support sales and marketing.  My strong passion for creative design provides motivation to dedicate most of my time to perfecting my craft by learning new programs, skills, and techniques.  I am always eager to learn new things and I quickly adapt to new environments.  Most importantly, I understand the difference between determination and commitment.  </p>

            <h2>Work History</h2>
                <p class="special">Previously employed as a Graphic Designer for the capital markets department of Newmark Real Estate until December 2022.  The position was responsible for developing and assisting any graphics, documents, and marketing materials for luxury high-rise properties; in addition to, organizing all files and real estate listings while collaborating with local and global design teams.  During my tenure with the company, my skills in utilizing Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Acrobat simultaneously were recognized by the Senior Graphic Designers as the most efficient method of designing documents, so I was designated to act as one of the instructors hosting virtual classes to educate the national team on multiple programs.</p>
                <p class="special">My last three jobs over the past two and a half years have revolved around using Adobe Creative Cloud in different work environments.  Initially, I worked in the print industry for a company named Mimaki, USA in Los Angeles where I would use Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign to create various samples to showcase the capabilities of the different printers that the company manufactured.   After working for Mimaki, I began working for Freeman Graphics that required utilizing Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to ensure that all files were designed, organized, and printed appropriately.  My most recent position with Newmark Real Estate entailed that I use Adobe InDesign to develop documents, graphics, and anything related to marketing as the sole graphic designer for the capital markets department. </p>
                <p class="special">I have utilized both Photoshop and Illustrator throughout my career in graphic design.  At least one program for Adobe Creative Suite was essential at every position I worked.  I am most adept in Illustrator using the pen tool and brush tool to vectorize or create logos and graphics; however, I have also mastered using Photoshop to edit photos as needed by utilizing the content-aware tool, adjustment layers, and masking.  At my previous position as a Graphic Designer within Newmark, I would often have to use Adobe Illustrator to create, re-create, and/or revise: logos, infographics, invitations, PDFs, and e-mail blasts.  I would also frequently assist in creating social media posts and printed graphics to help support the sales team at Mimaki, USA.  </p>
                <p class="special">I believe that all critiques, whether good or bad, should be taken into consideration when working on a task.  While working in the graphic design industry, I have come to understand that some clients and team members struggle to articulate their expectations for designs, so it is imperative that the designer understands how to interpret and incorporate any criticism that may help to create a design that better serves the needs of the client.</p>
